For the NAT detection to work, a udp server is needed to aid the detection
process. "server.py" is the server code that should be run on a server with
2 public IPs. EC2 is a one enviroment to set up such a server. 

In Amazon EC2 console, create a instance from a linux image. I chose to use
amzn-ami-hvm-2014.03.2.x86_64-ebs. The mancine need to have 2 private ips,
each of them will be mapped to a public elastic ip. "server.cfg" needs
to be updated with the 2 private ips and 2 mapped elastic ip. A new security
group needs to be established with port 6666 and 7666 open for incoming udp. 
I also openned 80 and 22 for TCP. The latter is for ssh access. 

After that, run server.py inside screen, and test it with client.py
from your own machine.
